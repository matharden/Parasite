{"name":"Parasite","tagline":"Simple Firefox Web development extension that enables switching the same page between hosting environments","body":"Parasite is a simple extension that enables switching the same page between hosting environments. In other words, open the same file path on a different domain name. Useful when working on a Web project that has multiple hosts/staging servers.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. Browse your live website: http://www.your-website.com/about/my-page.html\r\n2. Select another environment from the host list, e.g. 'LOCAL'\r\n3. Firefox then opens the same page on the selected host: http://localhost/about/my-page.html\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Hold CTRL to open in a new tab.\r\n* Hold SHIFT to open in a new window.\r\n* Label and re-order hosts as required.\r\n* Query string parameters and hashes supported.\r\n* Add as many hosts as you like in the options. Currently only supports one project (multiple projects available in future version).\r\n\r\nMany more features to come!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
